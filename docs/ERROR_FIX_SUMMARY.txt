DRAGON PHASE 3 ERROR FIX - SUMMARY

========================================
ERROR DESCRIPTION:
========================================
File: res://scripts/dragon_system/dragon_phase3.gd
Line: 88, Column: 5
Error: Function "calculate_stats()" not found in base self.

========================================
ROOT CAUSE:
========================================
The DragonPhase3 class was extending directly from Resource instead of Dragon:

BEFORE:
extends Resource
class_name DragonPhase3

This meant that DragonPhase3 didn't inherit the calculate_stats() method
from the Dragon class, even though it was trying to call it in _init().

========================================
SOLUTION APPLIED:
========================================

1. CHANGED INHERITANCE:
   - Changed "extends Resource" to "extends Dragon"
   - This gives DragonPhase3 access to all Dragon methods including calculate_stats()

2. REMOVED DUPLICATE DECLARATIONS:
   - Removed duplicate constants (now inherited from Dragon)
   - Removed duplicate properties (now inherited from Dragon) 
   - Removed duplicate signals (now inherited from Dragon)
   - Kept only Phase 3-specific additions

3. FIXED CONSTRUCTOR:
   - Changed from duplicated _init() implementation to:
     func _init(head: DragonPart = null, body: DragonPart = null, tail: DragonPart = null):
         super(head, body, tail)  # Call parent Dragon._init()

4. CLEANED DRAGON.GD:
   - Fixed duplicate variable/signal declarations in the base Dragon class

========================================
FINAL RESULT:
========================================
BEFORE: DragonPhase3 was a standalone Resource with duplicate code
AFTER:  DragonPhase3 properly extends Dragon with clean inheritance

✅ ERROR RESOLVED: calculate_stats() now available via inheritance
✅ CODE CLEANUP: No more duplicate declarations  
✅ PROPER OOP: Clean inheritance hierarchy
✅ COMPILATION: All scripts compile successfully

========================================
FILES MODIFIED:
========================================
- res://scripts/dragon_system/dragon_phase3.gd (main fix)
- res://scripts/dragon_system/dragon.gd (cleaned duplicates)

========================================
INHERITANCE HIERARCHY:
========================================
Resource (Godot built-in)
└── Dragon (base dragon functionality)
    └── DragonPhase3 (adds combat & exploration features)

Now DragonPhase3 has access to all Dragon methods:
- calculate_stats()
- feed()
- gain_experience() 
- take_damage()
- update_life_systems()
- And all other Dragon functionality

The error is completely resolved and the code follows proper OOP principles!
