# Dragon System Phase 2 - Advanced Features Implementation

## COMPLETED FEATURES

### 1. Dragon State Manager (dragon_state_manager.gd)
- Hunger System: Dragons get hungry every 30 minutes, starve after 1 hour
- Fatigue System: Dragons tire after 45 minutes of activity, need 15 minutes rest
- Health System: Automatic health regeneration when fed, starvation damage
- Experience & Leveling: 10-level progression with exponential EXP curve
- Death System: Dragons can die from starvation if not cared for
- AFK Mechanics: All systems run in background with 30-second update intervals

### 2. Mutation System (Holy Shit Moment!)
- Chimera Mutation: 1% chance for dragons to become ultimate hybrids
- Stat Boost: Chimera dragons gain ALL elemental bonuses simultaneously
- Visual Indication: Mutated dragons get "CHIMERA" in their name
- Manual Testing: Debug functions to force mutations for testing

### 3. Advanced Dragon Properties
Enhanced dragon.gd with new state tracking:
- hunger_level: 0.0 (fed) to 1.0 (starving)
- fatigue_level: 0.0 (rested) to 1.0 (exhausted)
- current_state: IDLE, TRAINING, EXPLORING, DEFENDING, RESTING
- last_fed_time: Unix timestamp for hunger calculations
- state_start_time: Track activity duration
- is_chimera_mutation: Boolean flag for mutated dragons

### 4. Signal System
Comprehensive event system for UI integration:
- dragon_level_up(dragon, new_level)
- dragon_hunger_changed(dragon, hunger_level)
- dragon_health_changed(dragon, current_health, max_health)
- dragon_death(dragon)
- chimera_mutation_discovered(dragon) - HOLY SHIT MOMENT!
- dragon_state_changed(dragon, old_state, new_state)

### 5. Debug & Testing Functions
- force_level_up(dragon, target_level): Instant leveling for testing
- force_mutation(dragon): Trigger Chimera mutation
- simulate_time_passage(dragon, hours): Skip time for AFK testing
- get_dragon_status(dragon): Complete status overview
- feed_dragon(dragon): Restore hunger and health

### 6. Comprehensive Test Suite (dragon_test_advanced.gd)
Full automated testing system that verifies:
- Dragon creation with mutation chances
- Experience and leveling progression  
- State management transitions
- AFK mechanics simulation
- Forced mutation system
- Death and starvation mechanics

## HOW TO TEST

### 1. Run the Advanced Test Scene
res://scenes/dragon_system/dragon_test_advanced.tscn

### 2. Use Debug Controls (In-Game Buttons)
- Level Up: Force dragon to next level
- Feed Dragon: Reset hunger and restore health
- Force Mutation: Trigger Chimera transformation
- Skip Time: Simulate 1 hour of AFK time

### 3. Watch Console Output
The test automatically runs comprehensive checks:
- Dragon creation attempts (tries for natural mutation)
- Level progression testing (1-4 levels)
- State management cycling
- AFK time simulation (2 hours)
- Forced mutation demonstration
- Death mechanics testing

## INTEGRATION POINTS

### Dragon Factory Enhancement
- Added mutation chance checking during dragon creation
- Chimera mutations now possible during normal gameplay
- State manager registration for all created dragons

### Future UI Hooks
All systems emit signals for easy UI integration

## PERFORMANCE NOTES

- Background Updates: 30-second intervals (lightweight)
- Singleton Pattern: DragonStateManager.instance for global access
- Efficient Calculations: Only active dragons are processed
- Memory Management: Dragons can be unregistered when not needed

## PHASE 2 STATUS: COMPLETE

All advanced dragon systems are implemented, tested, and ready for integration. 
The foundation is now in place for complex dragon management gameplay with AFK 
progression, mutations, and survival mechanics.

Next Phase Ready: UI integration, visual effects, and advanced gameplay features 
can now be built on this solid foundation.
