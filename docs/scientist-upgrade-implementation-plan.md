## üéØ Project Goals

Transform the current flat scientist system into a rich progression system with:
- **5 upgrade tiers** per scientist (Tier 0 = not hired, Tier 1-5 = upgrade levels)
- **Wave-based salary payments** (deducted after each wave)
- **Wave unlock requirements** (Tier 2 @ 25 waves, Tier 3 @ 50, Tier 4 @ 100, Tier 5 @ 200)
- **15 total automation abilities** (5 per scientist, unlocked progressively)
- **Full management UI** with upgrade cards showing abilities and costs

---

## üìã Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ What Exists
- Basic scientist system with 3 types (Stitcher, Caretaker, Trainer)
- Flat hire cost + per-minute salary model
- Simple automation: dragon creation, feeding/healing, XP granting
- Scientists tracked as boolean flags in dictionary
- Working wave defense system with tower assignments
- TreasureVault (gold), InventoryManager (parts), DragonFactory (dragons)
- Part decay system with freezer storage

### ‚ùå What's Missing
- No tier/level system
- No upgrade mechanics
- No wave-based payments
- No wave unlock requirements
- Missing 12 automation abilities
- No upgrade UI
- No scientist state serialization for save/load

---

## üîß Phase-by-Phase Implementation

---

### **PHASE 1: Create Scientist Resource Class** ‚è≥

**Goal:** Create the core Scientist resource with tier data and ability checks

**File:** `scripts/scientist/scientist.gd`

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `scientist.gd` with `class_name Scientist extends Resource`
- [ ] Add `enum Type { STITCHER, CARETAKER, TRAINER }`
- [ ] Add state variables: `scientist_type`, `tier` (0-5), `is_hired`
- [ ] Define `TIER_DATA` constants for all 3 scientists (names, costs, salaries)
- [ ] Define `UNLOCK_REQUIREMENTS` array [0, 0, 25, 50, 100, 200]
- [ ] Add getter methods: `get_tier_name()`, `get_salary()`, `get_upgrade_cost()`
- [ ] Add validation: `can_upgrade(waves_completed)`
- [ ] Add 15 ability check methods:
  - Stitcher: `can_create_dragons()`, `can_auto_assign_defense()`, `can_auto_explore()`, `can_emergency_recall()`, `can_auto_freeze()`
  - Caretaker: `can_feed()`, `can_heal()`, `can_rest()`, `can_prevent_starvation()`, `can_repair_towers()`
  - Trainer: `enables_training()`, `can_auto_fill_training()`, `can_auto_collect_training()`, `can_auto_rotate()`, `can_passive_xp()`
- [ ] Add save/load: `to_save_dict()`, `load_from_dict()`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Can create Scientist instance: `var s = Scientist.new()`
- Can check abilities by tier: `s.tier = 3; s.can_auto_explore() == true`
- Can get upgrade info: `s.get_upgrade_cost()` returns correct value
- Wave requirements work: `s.can_upgrade(30)` returns correct bool

**Dependencies:** None

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours

---

### **PHASE 2: Rewrite ScientistManager** ‚è≥

**Goal:** Replace boolean dictionary with Scientist instances and tier-based hiring/upgrading

**File:** `scripts/managers/scientist_manager.gd`

**Tasks:**
- [ ] **BACKUP:** Copy current `scientist_manager.gd` ‚Üí `scientist_manager_backup.gd`
- [ ] Replace `var hired_scientists: Dictionary` with:
  ```gdscript
  var stitcher: Scientist
  var caretaker: Scientist
  var trainer: Scientist
  ```
- [ ] In `_ready()`: Initialize 3 Scientist instances
- [ ] Rewrite `hire_scientist(type)`:
  - Check if already hired (tier >= 1)
  - Deduct Tier 1 hire cost from TreasureVault
  - Set `scientist.tier = 1` and `scientist.is_hired = true`
  - Emit `scientist_hired` signal
- [ ] Add new `upgrade_scientist(type)`:
  - Check if scientist is hired
  - Check wave requirements: `scientist.can_upgrade(DefenseManager.wave_number)`
  - Deduct upgrade cost
  - Increment `scientist.tier += 1`
  - Emit `scientist_upgraded` signal
- [ ] Update `get_total_salary()`: Sum salaries from all 3 scientists
- [ ] Add `pay_salaries()` method (called by DefenseManager):
  - Calculate total salary cost
  - Deduct from TreasureVault
  - Return success/failure
  - Emit `salary_paid` or `salary_failed` signal
- [ ] Remove per-minute cost timers (no longer needed)
- [ ] Update all automation methods to use tier checks:
  - `if stitcher.can_create_dragons():` instead of `if hired_scientists[STITCHER]:`
- [ ] Update `to_dict()` / `from_dict()` to serialize Scientist objects

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Can hire scientist at Tier 1: `hire_scientist(Scientist.Type.STITCHER)`
- Can upgrade scientist: `upgrade_scientist(Scientist.Type.STITCHER)` increases tier
- Salary payments work: `pay_salaries()` deducts correct gold amount
- Wave requirements block upgrades: Can't upgrade to Tier 2 until 25 waves
- Automation still works with tier checks

**Dependencies:** Phase 1 (Scientist class must exist)

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

---

### **PHASE 3: Integrate Salary Payments** ‚è≥

**Goal:** Hook salary payments into wave completion system

**File:** `scripts/managers/defense_manager.gd`

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Open `defense_manager.gd`, find `_complete_wave()` method
- [ ] Add salary payment call after wave victory:
  ```gdscript
  if victory:
      var rewards = _calculate_rewards(enemies)
      _apply_rewards(rewards)

      # Pay scientist salaries
      if ScientistManager.instance:
          ScientistManager.instance.pay_salaries()

      wave_number += 1
  ```
- [ ] Test salary deduction happens after each wave
- [ ] Handle insufficient funds (show notification or auto-fire scientists)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Salaries deducted after each wave victory
- Gold correctly deducted from TreasureVault
- Signals emit for UI updates
- Game doesn't crash if player can't afford salaries

**Dependencies:** Phase 2 (ScientistManager must have `pay_salaries()`)

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

---

### **PHASE 4: Stitcher Automation (5 Tiers)** ‚è≥

**Goal:** Implement all 5 Stitcher automation abilities

**File:** `scripts/managers/scientist_manager.gd`

- [ ] Remove from defense: `DefenseManager.remove_dragon_from_defense(dragon)`
- [ ] Dragon returns to IDLE state to rest
- [ ] Emit action performed signal

#### Tier 4: Prevent starvation
- [ ] Modify existing feed logic:
  ```gdscript
  var hunger_threshold = 50.0
  if caretaker.can_prevent_starvation():
      hunger_threshold = 20.0  # More aggressive

  if dragon.hunger_level > (100 - hunger_threshold):
      _feed_dragon(dragon)
  ```
- [ ] Priority feed dragons below 20% hunger

#### Tier 5: Auto-repair towers

  ```gdscript
  if trainer.can_auto_rotate():
      await get_tree().create_timer(10.0).timeout
      if dragon.current_state == Dragon.DragonState.IDLE:
          # Send back to training
          var empty_slots = TrainingManager.get_empty_slots()
          if empty_slots.size() > 0:
              TrainingManager.assign_to_training(dragon, empty_slots[0])
  ```
- [ ] Creates continuous training loop

#### Tier 5: Passive XP gain
- [ ] Add to existing `_on_trainer_work()`:
  ```gdscript
  if trainer.can_passive_xp():
      for dragon in factory.active_dragons:
          if dragon.current_state == Dragon.DragonState.DEFENDING:
              dragon_state_manager.gain_experience(dragon, 1)  # 10% of normal
          elif dragon.current_state == Dragon.DragonState.EXPLORING:
              dragon_state_manager.gain_experience(dragon, 0.5)  # 5% of normal
  ```

- [ ] Tier 2: Idle dragons auto-fill training slots
- [ ] Tier 3: Completed dragons auto-collected
- [ ] Tier 4: Collected dragons auto-rotated back to training
- [ ] Tier 5: Passive XP for defending/exploring dragons

#### UI Testing
- [ ] ScientistCard shows correct tier and abilities

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All 15 automation abilities working
- All tier unlocks working at correct waves
- Salary payments deducting correctly
- UI displaying accurate information
- Save/load preserving all state

**Dependencies:** Phases 1-9

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

---

### **PHASE 11: Balance Tuning & Bug Fixes** ‚è≥

**Goal:** Adjust costs/benefits and fix any discovered issues

**Tasks:**

#### Balance Review
- [ ] Test early game (waves 1-25):
  - Can player afford Tier 1 Caretaker?
  - Are salaries too expensive?
- [ ] Test mid game (waves 25-100):
  - Can player afford multiple Tier 2-3 scientists?
  - Is progression too fast/slow?
- [ ] Test late game (waves 100+):
  - Can player afford Tier 4-5 scientists?
  - Are high-tier abilities worth the cost?

#### Cost Adjustments (if needed)
- [ ] Adjust hire costs if too cheap/expensive
- [ ] Adjust upgrade costs if progression too fast/slow
- [ ] Adjust salaries if bankrupting player

#### Bug Fixes
- [ ] Fix any crashes found during testing
- [ ] Fix any automation not working correctly
- [ ] Fix any UI display issues
- [ ] Fix any save/load bugs

#### Polish
- [ ] Add sound effects for hire/upgrade
- [ ] Add visual feedback for automation actions
- [ ] Add tooltips for abilities
- [ ] Add animations for tier upgrades

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- No crashes during normal gameplay
- Costs feel balanced for progression pace
- All automation working reliably
- UI looks polished and professional

**Dependencies:** Phase 10 (testing must reveal issues first)

**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours

## üö® Risk Mitigation

**Potential Issues:**

1. **Breaking Existing Automation**
   - Mitigation: Backup original file, test thoroughly after Phase 2
   - Rollback: Restore `scientist_manager_backup.gd`

2. **Save Game Compatibility**
   - Mitigation: Add migration logic for old saves
   - Fallback: Default all scientists to tier 0 if load fails

3. **Performance Impact**
   - Mitigation: Keep automation timer intervals (60s/30s)
   - Monitor: Check FPS during automation cycles

4. **Balance Issues**
   - Mitigation: Placeholder costs based on spec, adjust in Phase 11
   - Iteration: Playtest at different wave counts

## üìù Notes & Decisions

### Design Decisions
- **Why per-wave salary instead of per-minute?**
  - Aligns with game's core loop (wave-based progression)
  - More predictable costs for player
  - Easier to balance with wave rewards

- **Why tier 0 = "not hired" instead of tier 1?**
  - Allows consistent array indexing (tier matches array index)
  - Clear state: tier 0 = disabled, tier 1+ = active

- **Why 6 hours for auto-freeze threshold?**
  - Gives players time to manually freeze if desired
  - Prevents last-minute decay for offline players
  - Matches "warning" urgency level in part system

### Open Questions
- [ ] Should scientists auto-fire if player can't afford salary?
- [ ] Should there be a "pause scientists" toggle?
- [ ] Should scientist portraits change per tier?
