## 🎯 Key Features

### Personality System
Each pet has one of 6 personalities that affect behavior:

| Personality | Exploration Bonus | Time Modifier | Destination Preference |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Curious** | +15% parts | Normal | Random |
| **Brave** | +10% all (dangerous) | Normal | High-danger locations |
| **Lazy** | +20% food | +50% time | Short trips |
| **Energetic** | -10% gold | -25% time | Short trips |
| **Greedy** | +25% gold | Normal | Gold-rich locations |
| **Gentle** | +15% affection gain | Normal | Safe locations |

### Affection Tiers
Bonding progression with reward scaling:

| Tier | Affection Range | Reward Bonus |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| Acquaintance | 0-19 | +0% |
| Friend | 20-39 | +5% |
| Companion | 40-59 | +10% |
| Best Friend | 60-79 | +15% |
| Soulbound | 80-100 | +25% |

**How to gain affection:**

## 🚧 What Still Needs to Be Done

### Scene Files (.tscn) - Manual Creation Required
The scripts are done, but Godot scene files must be created in the editor:

- [ ] `scenes/pet/pet_walking_character.tscn`
- [ ] `scenes/ui/pet/pet_introduction_popup.tscn`
- [ ] `scenes/ui/pet/pet_interaction_ui.tscn`
- [ ] `scenes/ui/pet/pet_status_widget.tscn`
- [ ] `scenes/ui/pet/pet_journal_ui.tscn`
- [ ] `scenes/ui/pet/welcome_back_popup.tscn`

**See `pet-integration-guide.md` for exact node structures!**

### Integration Hooks
Code changes needed in existing files:

- [ ] `exploration_manager.gd` - Add pet bonus application
- [ ] `save_load_manager.gd` - Add PetDragonManager save/load
- [ ] `new_player_init.gd` (or first dragon creation) - Create pet
- [ ] `main_scene.tscn/.gd` - Add walking pet and status widget
- [ ] Game startup - Add offline progress check

### Optional
- [ ] `game_state_checker.gd` - Emergency rescue system (autoload)
- [ ] Mood indicator sprites (happy/hungry/tired icons)
- [ ] Sparkle/heart particle effects
- [ ] Animation files for walking pet

## 🎮 Player Experience Flow

### First Time
1. Player creates first dragon → It becomes their pet
2. Pet introduction popup appears
3. Player names their pet
4. Pet starts walking around the screen
5. Pet status widget appears in HUD

### Daily Play
1. Pet auto-explores when idle (every ~15 minutes)
2. Player clicks pet → Opens interaction UI
3. Player can feed, pet, talk, check journal
4. Pet earns gold, parts, XP, and occasional gifts
5. Affection grows → Reward bonuses increase

### After Being Offline
1. Player opens game
2. Welcome back popup shows what pet accomplished
3. Player collects rewards (gold, parts, XP)
4. Can pet from welcome screen
5. Continue playing

### Long-Term Progression
- Days 1-7: Acquaintance → Friend
- Weeks 2-3: Companion
- Month 1: Best Friend
- Month 2+: Soulbound (max bonuses)

---

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

### Why This System Works

**1. Failsafe Mechanic**
- Pet cannot die → Player always has a dragon
- Auto-explores → Always generating resources
- Emergency rescue → Prevents game-over situations

**2. Emotional Investment**
- Personality makes each pet unique
- Affection creates long-term goals
- Memorable moments build narrative
- Journal creates nostalgia

**3. AFK Gameplay**
- Offline progress rewards returning players
- Auto-exploration works while AFK
- No punishment for taking breaks

**4. Reward Scaling**
- Early game: Small help (5-10% bonuses)
- Mid game: Meaningful aid (15-20% bonuses)
- Late game: Significant power (25% bonuses)

**5. Replayability**
- 6 different personalities
- Random dialogue and behaviors
- Different exploration strategies

## 🧪 Testing Commands (DevMenu)

Add these to your dev menu for testing:

```gdscript
# Set affection
PetDragonManager.instance.pet_dragon.affection = 80

# Add memorable moment
PetDragonManager.instance.pet_dragon.add_memorable_moment("Test", "This is a test")

# Add gift
PetDragonManager.instance.pet_dragon.pending_gifts.append({"name": "Test Gift", "description": "Test"})

# Reset pet cooldown
PetDragonManager.instance.pet_dragon.last_pet_time = 0

# Trigger emergency rescue
PetDragonManager.instance.generate_emergency_rewards()

# Simulate offline progress (1 hour)
var results = PetDragonManager.instance.calculate_offline_progress(3600)
print(results)
```
