## üìã Executive Summary

**Title**: DragonForge
**Genre**: Idle Management / Virtual Pet Simulator / Tower Defense Hybrid
**Platform**: Web (HTML5), with future mobile support
**Target Audience**: Casual gamers, idle game fans, pet simulation enthusiasts (Ages 13+)
**Elevator Pitch**: You're the head scientist of a dragon genetics laboratory. Create Frankenstein-style dragons from mismatched parts, hire assistant scientists to automate care, defend against knight raids, and grow from a scrappy one-dragon operation into a fully automated dragon empire‚Äîall while you're AFK.

**Core Hook**: "What if you ran a mad science lab that Frankensteins dragons together, and it kept working while you slept?"

## üéÆ Game Overview

### High Concept
DragonForge cmbines the engagement of virtual pet care (Tamagotchi), the satisfaction of automation progression (Factorio), and the strategic depth of tower defense‚Äîall wrapped in an AFK-friendly package where your laboratory keeps running even when you're away.

### Genre Blend
- **60% Idle Management**: Core progression happens through automation
- **25% Virtual Pet**: Direct dragon care creates emotional attachment
- **15% Tower Defense**: Strategic dragon assignment for defense

### Unique Selling Points

### AI-Powered Scientist Behavior

**Learning Algorithm**:
```gdscript
# Pseudocode for Builder scientist AI

func smart_part_selection():
    var preferences = analyze_player_history()
    # What elements do they use most?
    # Which dragons do they keep vs retire?
    # What synergies do they prefer?

    var parts = []
    for part_slot in [HEAD, BODY, TAIL]:
        var weights = {
            FIRE: preferences.fire_score,
            ICE: preferences.ice_score,
            # ... etc
        }
        parts.append(weighted_random(weights))

    return parts
```

**Performance Tracking**:
- Scientists show "efficiency rating" (0-100%)
- Based on: Tasks completed, resources saved, time optimization
- Low efficiency = needs upgrade
- High efficiency = reward bonus

## ‚öîÔ∏è Combat System (Deep Dive)

### Knight Raid Defense (Game Jam)

**Wave Mechanics**:
- Wave spawns every 5 minutes (300 seconds)

1. **Knight**: Balanced stats, common
2. **Mage**: High attack, low health
3. **Boss**: Appears every 10 waves, 2√ó stats

**Combat Resolution** (Automatic):
```
Dragon Total Power =
  (Attack √ó 1.0) + (Health √ó 0.5) + (Speed √ó 0.3)
  √ó (1.0 - Hunger √ó 0.2)  // Hungry dragons weaker
  √ó (1.0 - Fatigue √ó 0.15)  // Tired dragons weaker
  √ó Element_Bonus  // Advantage vs enemy type

Victory if: Dragon_Power >= Enemy_Power √ó 1.1
```

**Victory Rewards**:
- Gold: 10 + (wave_number √ó 5)
- Parts: 1 random element per enemy
- XP: 50 √ó wave_number per dragon

**Defeat Consequences**:
- Each dragon loses: Enemy_Power / Dragon_Count health
- Dragons can die if health reaches 0
- No rewards earned
- Wave counter resets to 1 (penalty)

### Combat System (Full Vision)

**Enemy Variety** (20+ types):
- Knights (tank), Archers (ranged), Mages (magic), Assassins (speed)

Shadow > All (20% bonus) but Rare to defend against
```

**Advanced Combat Features**:
- **Turn-based** (speed determines turn order)
- **Dragon abilities** trigger during combat
- **Combo system**: Multiple dragons of same element = bonus damage
- **Positioning**: Front/middle/back line strategy

## ü§ñ AI Integration (Jam Requirement)

### AI Usage #1: Dragon Name Generation

**System**: Claude API with prompt caching
```
Prompt: "Generate a unique fantasy dragon name based on:

- Body element: Ice
- Tail element: Lightning
Style: Epic, memorable, hints at mixed elements"

Output: "Frostbite the Voltaic Wyrm"
```

**Implementation**:
- Names generated on dragon creation
- Cached common combinations (saves API calls)
- Fallback to random generator if API fails
- Player can regenerate name (costs 10 gold)

### AI Usage #2: Smart Scientist Behavior

**Learning Algorithm**:
```python
class ScientistAI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.player_preferences = {
            'fire_usage': 0,
            'ice_usage': 0,
            # ... track element preferences
            'keep_rate': {},  # Which dragons kept vs retired
            'synergy_preference': 0  # Matching vs mixed
        }

    def observe_player_action(self, action):
        if action.type == "create_dragon":
            for part in action.parts:
                self.player_preferences[f'{part}_usage'] += 1

        if action.type == "retire_dragon":
            dragon_key = action.dragon.get_part_combo()
            self.player_preferences['keep_rate'][dragon_key] -= 1

    def smart_build_dragon(self):
        # Weight elements by usage frequency
        # Favor high keep_rate combinations
        # Apply synergy if player prefers it
        return optimized_part_selection()
```

**Visible AI Behavior**:
- Builder prioritizes player's favorite elements (60% of time)
- Trainer focuses on dragons used in defense
- Healer heals combat dragons first
- Feeder learns optimal feeding schedule per dragon

### AI Usage #3: Dynamic Difficulty (Full Vision)

**System**: Adaptive enemy scaling
```python
def calculate_wave_difficulty():
    player_power = sum(dragon.total_stats for dragon in active_dragons)
    recent_win_rate = last_10_battles.win_rate()

    target_win_rate = 0.65  # Aim for 65% win rate

    if recent_win_rate > 0.75:
        # Player winning too much, increase difficulty
        enemy_power = player_power * 1.2
    elif recent_win_rate < 0.50:
        # Player struggling, decrease difficulty
        enemy_power = player_power * 0.9
    else:
        # Balanced
        enemy_power = player_power * 1.1

    return generate_enemies(enemy_power)
```

**Benefits**:
- Always challenging but not impossible
- New players don't get frustrated
- Veterans don't get bored
- Smooth difficulty curve

## üéì Lessons & Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Respect Player Time**
- No forced waiting without purpose
- AFK progress is meaningful
- Short sessions are valid playstyle
- Can leave and return anytime

**2. Choices Over Grinding**
- Strategic decisions > repetitive tasks
- Automation removes busywork
- Focus on interesting choices (which dragons to build, where to explore)

**3. Fail Forward**
- Losing a defense still gives partial rewards
- Dead dragons can be resurrected (full vision)
- Mistakes are learning opportunities
- No dead-end progression paths

**4. Clear Feedback**
- Every action has visible result
- Progress bars and numbers everywhere
- Celebration of milestones
- Tooltips explain everything

**5. Accessible Complexity**
- Simple to start (feed dragon, assign to defense)
- Deep to master (optimal synergy builds, scientist management)
- Optional complexity (can ignore advanced features)

### What Makes This Game Special

**Unique Blend**:
- Most idle games lack manual control (Cookie Clicker)
- Most pet games lack automation (Tamagotchi)
- Most tower defense lacks persistence (Bloons)
- **This game combines all three**

**Emotional Hook**:
- You care about your dragons (virtual pet)
- You feel smart automating (idle progression)
- You feel powerful defending (tower defense)

**Satisfying AFK Loop**:
- Log off with confidence (scientists working)
- Return to tangible rewards (gold, new dragons)
- Immediate dopamine hit (claim rewards)
- New goals appear (next upgrade)
